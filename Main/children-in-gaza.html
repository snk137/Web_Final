            NEW YORK/AMMAN, 24 October 2023 – The Gaza Strip has witnessed a devastating toll on its children in the past 18 days, with 2,360 fatalities and 5,364 injuries due to relentless attacks, averaging over 400 children killed or injured daily. More than 30 Israeli children have also lost their lives, and dozens are held captive in Gaza. This is the deadliest escalation of hostilities since 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
            Almost every child in Gaza has been exposed to distressing events - widespread destruction, relentless attacks, displacement, and severe shortages of necessities like food, water, and medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
            "The killing, maiming, abduction of children, attacks on hospitals and schools, and the denial of humanitarian access are grave violations of children's rights," said Adele Khodr, UNICEF Regional Director. "UNICEF appeals for a ceasefire, humanitarian access, and hostage release. Even in war, rules exist. Civilians, especially children, must be protected."
        </p>
        <p>
            The West Bank has also seen a surge in casualties, with nearly 100 Palestinians, including 28 children, losing their lives and at least 160 children sustaining injuries. Even before the tragic events of October 7, 2023, West Bank children were facing the highest levels of conflict-related violence in two decades, resulting in 41 Palestinian children and six Israeli children losing their lives this year.
        </p>
        <p>
            The situation in Gaza is a growing stain on our conscience. The death and injury rate among children is staggering. Without easing tensions and allowing humanitarian aid, including food, water, medical supplies, and fuel, the daily death toll will continue to rise.
        </p>
        <p>
            To respond to the dire situation for children in the Gaza Strip, UNICEF is calling for:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>An immediate humanitarian ceasefire.</li>
            <li>All access crossings into Gaza to be opened for a safe, sustained and unimpeded access of humanitarian aid, including water, food, medical supplies, and fuel.</li>
            <li>Urgent medical cases in Gaza to be allowed to leave or to be able to receive critical health services.</li>
            <li>Respect and protection for civilian infrastructure such as shelters and schools, and health, electric, water and sanitation facilities, to prevent loss of civilian and children’s lives, outbreaks of diseases, and to provide care to the sick and wounded.</li>
        </ol>
